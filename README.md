# KPP Standalone

The GEOS-Chem KPP Standalone takes a given set of initial conditions to replicate
grid cell chemistry of 3D GEOS-Chem, GCHP, or GEOS-CF runs. It reads an input file generated by the KPP Standalone Interface that generates model output of the full chemical state of the grid cell. The full GEOS-Chem mechanism is run to replicate the chemistry of the specified grid cell.

The KPP Standalone is adapted from a box model used in the following publication:
Lin, H., Long, M. S., Sander, R., Sandu, A., Yantosca, R. M., Estrada, L. A., et al. (2023). An adaptive auto-reduction solver for speeding up integration of chemical kinetics in atmospheric chemistry models: Implementation and evaluation in the Kinetic Pre-Processor (KPP) version 3.0.0. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 15, e2022MS003293. [https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003293](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003293)

The Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) files can be modified and the mechanism rebuilt with KPP (see below).  Then, the KPP Standalone can be rebuilt with make.


## User-modifiable KPP files (taken from KPP/fullchem -- folder for the default GEOS-Chem mechanism)

This folder contains the files that define the full-chemistry mechanism (NOx-Ox-VOCs-Br-Cl-I) for GEOS-Chem.

  1. **fullchem.kpp**: Master KPP specification file.

  2. **fullchem.eqn**: KPP equation file, contains reaction definitoins.

  3. **fullchem_HetStateFuncs.F90**: This module contains functions
     that initialize the HetChem state object.

  4. **fullchem_SulfurChemFuncs.F90**: This module contains routines
     that compute rates for SO2 reactions in cloud.

  5. **fullchem_RateLawFuncs.F90**: This module contains functions
	 that compute rates for heterogenous chemistry reactions.  This is
	 the so-called "rate law library" for the fullchem mechanism.

  6. **rateLawUtilFuncs.F90**: This module contains several utility
     functions for heterogeneous chemistry reactions.

  7, **commonIncludeVars.H**: Global variables that are used for all
      KPP mechanisms.  These will be inlined into the KPP-generated
      **gckpp_Global.F90** file.

The following files link to the KPP/stubs folder.  These include stub
subroutines that are used by other chemical mechanisms.  The stubs are
needed in order to avoid compilation errors.

  1. **stub_aciduptake_DustChemFuncs.F90** Stub routines corresponding
     to the KPP/aciduptake/aciduptake_DustChemFuncs.F90 module,

  2. **stub_Hg_HetStateFuncs.F90**: Stub routines corresponding
     to the KPP/Hg/Hg_HetStateFuncs.F90 module.

## Files generated by KPP

With the exception of the symbolic link **gckpp.kpp**, and the map
file **gckpp.map**, all files starting with the prefix **gckpp_** are
generated by KPP.  These contain the specifications of the chemical
mechanism in efficient source code.
